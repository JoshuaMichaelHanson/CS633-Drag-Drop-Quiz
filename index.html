        <h3>Doc Control:</h3>
        Document control refers to the systematic management and regulation of documents within an organization,
        ensuring that the creation, distribution, retrieval, and storage processes are organized and secure. It involves
        establishing procedures and protocols to manage document versions, approvals, and access, maintaining accuracy
        and compliance with relevant standards or regulations.

        <h3>Source Management:</h3>
        Code source management, also known as version control or version management, is a systematic process that
        involves tracking changes to source code during software development. It enables collaboration among multiple
        developers, provides a history of changes, and allows for the management of different versions of the codebase,
        ensuring a controlled and organized development workflow.

        <h3>Peer Reviews:</h3>
        Peer reviews involve the examination and evaluation of work by one's colleagues or peers within a team or
        professional setting. These reviews provide constructive feedback, help ensure quality, and promote
        collaboration among team members.

        <h3>Defect Tracking:</h3>
        Defect tracking is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing issues or flaws in software during its
        development lifecycle. It involves monitoring and recording details about defects, such as their nature,
        severity, and resolution status, to ensure effective problem resolution and improve overall software quality.

        <h3>System Test:</h3>
        System testing is a phase in the software development life cycle where the entire software system is tested as a
        whole to ensure that all components work together as intended. It aims to validate the system's functionality,
        performance, and other non-functional requirements before it is deployed for actual use.

        <h3>Requirements:</h3>
        Requirements refer to the documented specifications or criteria that define the features, functionalities, and
        constraints of a system, product, or project. These specifications serve as a foundation for development,
        guiding the design and implementation process to meet the intended goals and user needs.

        <h3>Generative Chatbot:</h3>
        A generative chatbot is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that utilizes natural language processing
        and machine learning to generate responses in a more dynamic and context-aware manner. Unlike rule-based
        chatbots, generative chatbots can understand and generate human-like responses based on the input they receive,
        allowing for more flexible and adaptive interactions.

        <h3>Virutal Meetings:</h3>
        A virtual meeting is an online gathering where participants from different locations connect through digital
        communication tools, engaging in real-time discussions, collaboration, and information sharing. It enables
        remote individuals to interact as if they were physically present in the same location, utilizing video, audio,
        and other collaborative features.

        <h3>Hosting Platform:</h3>
        A hosting platform refers to an online service or infrastructure that allows individuals or organizations to
        deploy, store, and manage their websites, applications, or other digital content on the internet. These
        platforms provide the necessary resources, such as server space, storage, and network connectivity, enabling
        users to make their online content accessible to others.

        <h3>Unit Test:</h3>
        A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a program are tested in
        isolation to ensure they function as intended. These tests focus on verifying the correctness of small,
        independent parts of the code, typically at the function or method level.

        <h3>Static Analysis:</h3>
        Static analysis is a software testing method that examines the source code of a program without executing it,
        identifying potential issues, errors, or security vulnerabilities. It helps developers catch coding errors early
        in the development process by analyzing the code's structure, syntax, and semantics.
